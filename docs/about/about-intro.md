# The Developer Finance Guide

### Welcome

The Developer Finance Guide contains carefully curated content to help you navigate the world of personal finance. As you progress through your career as a developer, your financial position will change and so will your questions about money.&#x20;

This guide aims to answer those personal finance questions that are top-of-mind - whether that be how to maximise tax rebates while working from home, figuring out how your salary compares to other developers or how you can better customise your banking.&#x20;

### Our partners

We have partnered with [**Investec**](https://www.investec.com/en\_za.html) to provide in-depth insights from financial experts. Investec is committed to enabling software developers in South Africa, not only by providing innovative financial products, but by assisting with financial education. Where relevant, we have also consulted with other financial experts to make sure we have covered all the bases.&#x20;

In addition, we have worked closely with members of the [**OfferZen developer community**](https://www.offerzen.com/community) to develop the framework for this guide and ensure that the content we include is valuable and useful to you.&#x20;
