The [**Programmable Banking Community**](https://offerzen.gitbook.io/programmable-banking-community-wiki/) is a community of software devs on a mission to make Programmable Banking a reality for South African developers and businesses.

The community is a space for sharing ideas and connecting with other developers interested in building out new fintech solutions. Our core focus as a community is to support each other to unlock the potential of Programmable Banking for everyone.

### Who is the community for?

The community is for individuals with a passion for technology. If you are interested in building on the banking experience and helping ignite other’s imagination, this is the place for you.
