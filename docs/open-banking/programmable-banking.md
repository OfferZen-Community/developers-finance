# Programmable banking

### Investec Programmable Banking

Investec, in collaboration with the OfferZen community, has [made Investec Private and Business Bank Accounts programmable](https://www.investec.com/en\_za/banking/programmable-banking.html) so you can code your own bank experience.

You can build your own rules and limits using securely hosted Javascript cloud functions that execute before and after your card transactions. In addition, you can get your account, balance, transaction and transfer data through the REST API.&#x20;

### Programmable Banking Community&#x20;

OfferZen and Investec are working with the Programmable Banking community to enable developers to access the world of banking. The community is a space for sharing ideas and connecting with other developers interested in building out new fintech solutions.&#x20;

Writing code alone is not fun, building something new is even harder! Discovering and then refining those use cases and code snippets (don’t kid yourself, we all use code snippets!) is the other part; and this is rarely effective when done in isolation.

Conversations with other passionate developers reveal ideas we never knew we had. Friendly debates help us clarify our views. A casual comment can uncover new ways for us to think and build. Interacting with diverse sets of people radically expands our vision and insights into a problem.

Our core focus as a community is to support each other to unlock the potential of Programmable Banking for everyone. Working together as a tribe of South African developers who want to solve business problems using Programmable Banking.

**Who is the community for?**

The community is for individuals with a passion for technology. If you are interested in building on the banking experience and helping ignite other’s imagination, this is the place for you

> **“It's a proper community! Didn't expect that. Thought it was going to be impersonal.”**

> **“I really enjoyed the demos (at the meetup). This opened up my eyes to a side of software development that I was not previously immersed in."**
