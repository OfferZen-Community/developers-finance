# Salary benchmarking

### How does my salary compare to other devs in SA?


The graph above shows the average salaries of South African developers across seniority levels in 2022. 
That said, average salaries are single data points and only one part of a bigger story: Many developers may earn significantly more or significantly less and averages should not be used to estimate what your actual salary will or should be.

Salaries are affected by many factors, like location, industry, individual background, language, perks and nature of work. Most developers are “fluent” in several languages which will affect the final figures as well.

It’s also important to keep in mind that every individual’s context is different. At the end of the day, salary is a personal conversation that should take place between employee and employer.
