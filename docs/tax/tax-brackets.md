# Tax brackets

### Into which tax bracket do I fall?&#x20;

The amount of your [**taxable income**](https://developers-finance-ten.vercel.app/docs/tax/income-tax-and-capital-gains-tax) determines the tax bracket in which you will fall. For the **2023 year of assessment**, running from 1 March 2022 to 28 February 2023, an individual’s taxable income is taxed in terms of the following table:

|Taxable income (R)|Rates of tax (R)|
|--|--|
|1 – 226 000 | 18% of taxable income|
|226 001 – 353 100 | 40 680 + 26% of taxable income above 226 000|
|353 101 – 488 700 |73 726 + 31% of taxable income above 353 100|
|488 701– 641 400|115 762 + 36% of taxable income above 488 700|
|641 401 – 817 600 |170 734 + 39% of taxable income above 641 400|
