## Home office tax deductions

Russell Knight CA(SA), an OfferZen community member, shares his insights on home office tax deductions. 

### Is there a difference in tax treatment for a home office if I am a salaried employee vs. a contractor? 

Yes, there is a difference in the treatment if you are:
* **A fixed salary employee (>50% of your remuneration is a fixed salary)**
* A commission-based employee (>50% variable)
* An independent contractor 

**The information below is only applicable to <u>fixed-salary employees</u>.**

### What constitutes a home office? 
A home office is a room that must meet **ALL of the following conditions**:

* **Used for the purpose of “trade”** - this means that you must be using the home office for the purpose of your employment. 

* **Regularly and mainly used** - this means that more than 50% of your working time in a particular year of assessment must be spent working in the home office, where the unit of measure is working days and vacation/leave (non-working days) are excluded from the calculation.

>   **For example**
(Assuming 250 working days in the tax year)
* You worked 150 days of the tax year in your home office.  
**150/250 = 60%, therefore you can claim a home office tax deduction.**
* You worked 90 days of the tax year in your home office and were on leave for 20 working days.  
**90/(250-20) = 39%, therefore you cannot claim a home office tax deduction.**
* You worked for Employer A for 100 working days of the tax year at the employer's premises. Then you move to employer B and worked from home for 50 days in a home office.  
**50/250 =20%, therefore you cannot claim a home office tax deduction.**


* **Exclusively used** - this means that you may not use the home office for any other purpose other than trade or work function, except for trivial usage. This requirement is applied strictly and applies after working hours and on weekends. In many cases, this factor will prevent a deduction, as many people use their home office for other purposes when it is not in use during working hours.

> **For example**
* You take personal phone calls whilst in your home office - trivial use, does not impact a claim.
* Your home office is used as a guest bedroom - not exclusive use, cannot claim.
* Your home office serves as a storage room for linen in a cupboard - exclude the linen cupboard from home office m<sup>2</sup>, claim for the portion excluding the linen cupboard.

* **Specifically equipped** - this means that the room must house the equipment needed for employment and this would differ depending on the nature of the employee's work. For a regular knowledge worker, this would include items such as a workstation, chair, computer and communication equipment. 

### What expenses could qualify for home office tax deduction?

In general, you should not be thinking about deductions as mimicking the work environment that you had when working at the office eg. coffee supplied and bathroom facilities. The focus is on the use of the **home office space itself** and the building in which it is located.
* Rent of your premises (if you are renting) 
* Cost of repairs
* Rates
* Cleaning costs
* Security costs
* Building insurance 
* Office desk and chair wear and tear allowance.

### What expenses would <u>not</u> qualify for home office tax deduction?

* Improvements - building an additional room on to the home office or changing the home office. A common example of an improvement would be an alternative energy supply that is wired into the electricity circuit of your property.
* Interest on your mortgage: from the 2023 tax year onwards, this could, however, be disputed.
* Items that aren’t connected to the <u>premises</u>, even if required for you to perform your trade:
>* Water
>* Household contents insurance
>* Internet 
>* Stationary 
>* Tea, coffee and refreshments

### How do I calculate the deduction amount? 

**Deduction = (HomeOffice m<sup>2</sup> / AllBuildings m<sup>2</sup>) X (QualifyingExpenses)**

* All buildings on the property need to be taken into account with regard to total floor area (including garages, outbuildings). Land or erf size is not relevant for the calculation. 
* The calculation must be based on accurate measurements and cannot be an estimate.
* Any portion of kitchen or bathroom facilities cannot be considered part of the home office m<sup>2</sup>, as they are not used exclusively for trade. 

### Where do I input my home office tax deduction information?

* In your ITR12 return, home office deduction falls under the section “Other deductions” in the return.
* In the form generation Wizard at the start, answer “Yes” to: **“Did you incur any expenditure that you wish to claim as a deduction that was not addressed by the previous questions?”**
* Enter the deduction amount next to source code: 4028 (Home office expenses)

### How likely am I to be audited on my home office expenses?
* SARS are likely to verify (via a desk audit at least) home office claims, especially in your first year of making such a claim. 
* You should have the following documents ready:
>* Documentary proof that your employer requires or permits you to work from home e.g. a letter from the employer or contract if stated therein.
>* Photographs of your home office.
>* Floor plans of the property with dimensions.
>* Supporting documentation for qualifying expenses used in calculation e.g. utility bill etc.
>* Schedule of expenses claimed and details of apportionment calculation.
>* Schedule of dates detailing when home office was used during the year of assessment.
>* If renting – lease agreement + schedule of lease payments.

### Can I claim home office for past years if I qualify?

You would need to request to reopen those years of assessments to correct them.

### I live in a complex/flat.  How do I deal with the other buildings/flats?

The home office is apportioned only for the section that you pay levies for – other units and common property do not get taken into account in the calculation.

## What happens when I sell the house in which I have been operating my home office?

* The first R2 million of a capital gain from the sale of a primary residence is exempt from Capital Gains Tax (CGT).
* The portion of the residence claimed as a home office results in a tainting of this portion, as it was used for trade.
* The home office portion of the residence will not be eligible for the R2 million exemption (but the full R2 million can still be applied to the rest of the property).
* CGT will be applicable to the home office on a time apportioned basis (as the value of the property appreciates over time).
* **An average person will probably require the advice of a Tax practitioner to complete their tax return for the tax year in which primary residence is sold, if a home office deduction was claimed.**
