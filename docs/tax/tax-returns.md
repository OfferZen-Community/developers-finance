# Tax returns

### What should I do to prepare for my tax return?&#x20;

Ensure you have all your supporting documents on record before completing your next tax return. See non-exhaustive list of supporting documentation below:

* **IRP5**: This is the employeesâ€™ tax certificate your employer issues to you
* Certificates you received for **local interest income** earned
* Any other documentation relating to **income received or accrued**, such as remuneration that has not been reported to SARS by your employer, or business, property rental or investment income, etc.
* **Medical tax certificate** and details of medical expenses paid and medical scheme contributions made
* The relevant certificates reflecting your **retirement annuity fund contributions** made
* A logbook and other documents in support of **business travel expenses** (if the travel allowance is part of your remuneration or if you have the right of use of a company car taxable benefit)
* Any other documentation relating to the **allowable deductions you wish to claim**.

**Disclaimer**: *The answers above are only applicable to individuals who are exclusively regarded as tax residents of South Africa. This is for information purposes only, and we urge clients to seek independent tax advise to ensure that your tax circumstances have been properly considered.*
