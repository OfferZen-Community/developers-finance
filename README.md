# üí∏ Welcome to the Developer Finance Guide üí∏

### Background 

Welcome! 

We decided to develop this guide after having a number of conversations with devs within our community about financial education and wellness.

OfferZen's partnership with Investec has given us access to experts in the finance field, with a wealth of finance knowledge that we've been able to tap into. Where relevant, we have also consulted with other financial experts to make sure we have covered all the bases.

**Some learnings that we have gathered along this journey so far are**: 

* There are specific finance themes that tend to resonate more with developers than other folks due to the nature of dev work (eg. remote work, contracting)and the nature of makers in general (eg. starting side hustles, crypotcurrency and other fintech).

* There are also some finance basics that are more generally applicable and these tend to more or less interesting for devs depending on where they are in their career. For example, someone just starting out might not know how to figure out their taxes, whereas a senior dev will likely have that sorted.

* In the SA market, the content that is out there currently doesn't seem to be meeting this need, is often trying to sell something else and there isn't certainty around whether the information can be trusted.

We hope that you find the content useful as you navigate the world of finance!
